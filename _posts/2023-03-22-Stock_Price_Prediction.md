#we can find the predicted price of any stock using 3 attributes, spot price , volatility and riskfree rate which are used in the monte carlo simulation 

#testing the function separately

Price_predicted(120,0.03,0.032)

#this price predicted is very scalable for those who want to make immediate profits 
#from speculation type of investments, who want to make huge profits in one or two days
#using Monte Carlo equation in this code of price predicted we are predicting the price of 
#stocks by giving only 3 main market attributes

#creating important objects for collecting stock data in a loop

library("quantmod")

last_prices_portfolio <- list()
stock_objects <- list()

#here we can easily edit the portfolio we want to analyze
portfolio <- c("AAPL", "MSFT","TSLA", "JPM", "PG")

#using loop we can get the currently trading price for stocks
#Loop definition
for (i in portfolio){
  getSymbols(i)
  
  # Extract the last traded price for the current ticker and add it to our list
  #stock name is defined in list and latest stock price is coming from yahoo finance using library
  last_price <- tail(Cl(get(i)), 1)

  # Create an instance of the Stock Info class with the ticker and price

#this loop enables us to get the current prices for all the stocks we have in portfolio, using quantmod library
#and we are using the stock class again here to get all the attributed for each of the 
#stock in the portfolio along with the current prices. so this can be very scalable if
# anyone is intrested in analysis of stocks and he has to consider all the factors at a time , 
#so he can compare stocks and make adjustments in portfolio to increase the profit, using this loop





#####################################
#USE OF Lapply for vectorization of the code


#Using Vectorization to run code in one line for all the classes
lapply(stock_objects, function(instance) instance$Price_predicted(instance$Price,instance$Volatility, instance$RFree))

#Using Vectorization to run code in one line for all the classes to print the volatility
lapply(stock_objects, function(instance) print(instance$Volatility))

#Using Vectorization to run code in one line for all the classes to increase the volatility by 0.01
lapply(stock_objects, function(instance) (instance$Volatility= instance$Volatility +0.01))

# sometimes the volatility and other fators of stocks changes by some percentage points so this type of v
#lapply vectorization technique can be very useful to change market variables.
